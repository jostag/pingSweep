# pingSweep
This is a C# program for doing a ping sweep of a network. Run the program.cs file as a executable. 
Then follow the on screen instructions on the screen. It will send ICMP echo requests to all devices on your network.
It will list all IP addresses in use as well as tell you the number of devices on the network. 
This only works if the devices respond to ICMP echo requests.
